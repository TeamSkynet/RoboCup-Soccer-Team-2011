/** @class Player
* The Player class defines all objects and methods used for the 
* Player within the RoboCup match.  The Player establishes a connection
* to the server, initializes itself on the team, and 
* performs all actions related to a RoboCup soccer player such as
* (but not limited to) kicking, dashing, dribbling, passing and scoring. 
* The Player class has a Memory for storing the current RoboCup worldstate.
* It reacts to stimuli based on strategies provided by the Brain (TBD).
