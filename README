Source code for skynet client for RoboCup Soccer Simulator server (v15).

To compile:
At the command line, enter
	javac @complist.txt
	

Using the client:

1) Launch the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server (v15).
2) Launch the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Monitor.
3) From a terminal window (outside of the Server terminal), enter 
	java Game
   The client will initialize a team of 11 players, and position them throughout the field.  The worldstate from the perspective
   of each player will be stored in memory during each server heartbeat.

To run additional tests, restart the soccer server and run one of the following from the command line:
	GoalieTest
	StrikerAgent
	TestDefensive
	TestAction

Please note that you must restart the RoboCup Soccer Simulation Server in order to run any of these clients again.  If you run the
client a second time without restarting the server, the server will not be able to initialize any new players because the limit 
for a single team will have already been reached.
